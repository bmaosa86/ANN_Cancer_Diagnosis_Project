# ANN Cancer Diagnosis Project

This repository contains my implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for cancer diagnosis using TensorFlow.

## Project Overview
The project uses a Kaggle dataset that includes diagnostic features to classify tumors as malignant or benign.  
The ANN model was developed and trained in TensorFlow with two hidden layers, dropout regularization, and early stopping.

## Contents
- **01_ann_cancer_diagnosis.ipynb** — main notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  
- **Ann_Cancer_Diagnosis_Data.csv** — dataset used for model development.  
- **artifacts/** — folder with the saved model, scaler, feature columns, and metadata.  
- **README.md** — project documentation.

## Key Results
- Validation Accuracy: ~99%
- Precision: 97.7%
- Recall: 100%
- F1-score: 98.8%
- AUC: 1.00

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.  
3. Run the cells sequentially.  
4. Saved model and metadata are in the `artifacts` folder.
